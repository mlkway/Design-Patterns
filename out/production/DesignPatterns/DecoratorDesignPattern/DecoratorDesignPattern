What is The Decorator Desing Pattern ??

    The Decorator Allows you to modify an object dynamically and you would use this pattern when
    you want the capabilieties of inheritance with but you need to add functionality at runtime
    you want this thing to be dynamic it is more flexible than inheritance and it is going to
    simplify your code because you add functionality using many many simple classes rather than trying to do
    all this throug inheritance and the great thing about it is it allows to rather than rewrite old code you are now
    going to using the decorator design pattern extend with brand new code and keep everything the way that it was
